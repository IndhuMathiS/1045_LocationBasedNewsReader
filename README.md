7.About (Short Description / Summary):Recently, Internet has become the sole source of information in any domain. Updates from websites are obtained from XML based RSS feeds. A web service is developed to deliver filtered news items from RSS feeds to a mobile client. Each news item is indexed; subsequently, the indexes are used for filtering news items based on different categories. The default location of the user is obtained using geoLocator. For a better understanding the location of the user is pointed by a Pushpin in the map. In this project, a windows phone application is created in order to access filtered news items based on the location. Speech synthesizer API is used for aiding visually impaired people. Sub-categories of news items are also provided for better clarity. Under Favourites category, Top News, Most Read, Most Recent, Opinions, Most Shared, Most commercials News. Under News category, Business, Sports, Education, Technology, Entertainment etc. Apart from the filtering of news the user can also search for the nearby places of interest for a  specific  radius. Also, the news is converted into text and they can be shared via SMS or can be uploaded as a post in Social networks like Facebook, Twitter.  \
